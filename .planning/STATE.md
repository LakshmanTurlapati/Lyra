# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-20)

**Core value:** Curate Opus-quality training data that makes a 1.7B parameter model practically useful for day-to-day development tasks -- tool calls, quick code, and general reasoning.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Data Format and Pipeline Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Data Format and Pipeline Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-20 -- Roadmap created with 10 phases covering 32 requirements

Progress: [..........] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Evaluation framework built before training (Phase 3 before Phase 8) per research recommendation
- [Roadmap]: Domain datasets generated independently (Phases 4/5/6 parallelizable) to isolate failures per domain
- [Roadmap]: Format validation is foundational -- Phase 1 locks the ShareGPT schema before any data generation at scale

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SmolLM2 chat template specifics for tool calls need hands-on verification in Phase 1
- Optimal LoRA hyperparameters for 3-way multi-task at 1.7B need empirical sweep in Phase 8
